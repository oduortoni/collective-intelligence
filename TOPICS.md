### 1) HTTP as a Stateless protocol

What does "stateless" mean? If each request is independent, how does the server know a user is logged in instead of prompting them to log in every time? What are sessions or cookies? We will try to implement a very simple authentication mechanism that uses a file to remember a user's state each time they make a request. We will prove that even though each request may be independent and the server does not remember the user's previous actions, we can implement some features on top of http to make it easy to remember a user's actions.

### 2) What is a network and why are protocols important in a network

A network is a system of connected devices sharing resources and data. Protocols are the rules that allow devices in these networks to communicate effectively and securely, ensuring data is structured, transmitted, and received properly. Whether itâ€™s for sending an email, browsing a website, or transferring files, protocols are essential for making networks function smoothly and securely.
