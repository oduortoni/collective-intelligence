# Network Security and Protocol Implementation

**Theme: Secure Communication Protocols**

This sequence builds from security fundamentals through implementation, culminating in complete protocol design.

1. **SSL/TLS Architecture**
   - Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
   - Certificate management
   - Secure handshake process

2. **Secure Socket Programming**
   - Implementing SSL/TLS in applications
   - Key and certificate handling
   - Common security pitfalls

3. **Protocol Design and Implementation**
   - Custom protocol design principles
   - State machine implementation
   - Error handling and recovery
