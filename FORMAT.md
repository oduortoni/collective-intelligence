# Format for a session documentation

In the spirit of learning, we have discovered that there are different ways to explore a topic. 

**1.** A simple document

The topics that can be explored through human conversations will require a simple document. Be sure to simplify the document to the point where anyone can understand what you are talking about. Let your article be simple enough that it becomes a guide for future exploration. It should not be too detailed.

**2** A document and a bit of code

There are things that do not make sense on their own. In this case, you are allowed to create your own structure. The structure should hopefully contain a simple document to explain the overal idea you are trying to explain using your code. Guide the user through the codebase and what they need to take home. 

## examples

In the folder for week 1, there are two different ways to approach a topic. Go through the folder and find the style that suits you. One folder uses the first method while the other uses the other. You will be the one to decide what makes sense for you.

## finally

Have fun exploring!
