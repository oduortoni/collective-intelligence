# session format

In the spirit of learning, we have discovered that there are different ways to explore a topic. There are topics that can be explored through human conversations hence a simple document will do. Then we have topics that will require a bit of code to understand. In the folder for week 1, there are three different ways to approach a topic. Go through the folder and find the style that suits you. You can then pick a topic and then become the lead of that session on its appointed date.

Have fun exploring!
