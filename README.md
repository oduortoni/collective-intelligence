# Topics in Programming

This repository offers a simple introduction to key programming concepts. We’ll focus on the basics that are essential for building applications. While frameworks are useful, they are built on these core principles, and frameworks may change, but the basics stay the same. By mastering the fundamentals, you'll find it easier to learn more advanced topics, which are often just combinations of the basics.

AI is also a powerful tool that can help you develop applications faster, but understanding the fundamentals is essential. If you don’t know the basics, you may rely too much on AI, and when it struggles, you'll be stuck. With solid knowledge, you can use AI effectively and even know when its solutions are optimized.

Welcome and have fun!
