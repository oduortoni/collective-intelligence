# Concurrent Network Programming

**Theme: Building Scalable Network Applications**

These subjects form the foundation of building scalable network applications, progressing from basic I/O concepts to advanced multiplexing techniques.

1. **Blocking vs Non-Blocking I/O**
   - Understanding synchronous vs asynchronous operations
   - Impact on application performance
   - When to use each approach

2. **Threading Models in Network Applications**
   - Multi-threading fundamentals for network programming
   - Thread pools and resource management
   - Thread synchronization in network contexts

3. **I/O Multiplexing**
   - Understanding select(), poll(), and epoll()
   - Event-driven programming models
   - Implementing high-performance servers
