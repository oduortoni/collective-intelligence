# Concurrent Network Programming

**Theme: Building Scalable Network Applications**

These subjects form the foundation of building scalable network applications, progressing from basic I/O concepts to advanced multiplexing techniques.

1. **Blocking vs Non-Blocking I/O**
   - Understanding synchronous vs asynchronous operations
   - Impact on application performance
   - When to use each approach

2. **Threading Models in Network Applications i.e concurrrency** 
   - Thread pools implemented via goroutines and channels
   - Worker Pools in the context of goroutines
   - Synchronization between goroutines is handled via channels, sync package, or select statements

3. **I/O Multiplexing**
   - Understanding select in GO
   - Event-driven programming models
   - Implementing high-performance servers
